For Debian release:
- bashdb manual page
- GFDL or GPL for documentation? 
- install lib in /usr/share. Have bashdb fallback to 
 "@DEBUGGER_START_FILE@"? if no -L and no ../lib? 

BUGS

- *New to bash 3.x: The $BASH_COMMAND variable no longer works.

- Source can have parameters but that doesn't appear in ARGC, ARGV.
  RETURN trap should signal when leaving source'd file.

- Stack trace on rare occasions can get the wrong line number. 

- Interrupts to program sometimes are delayed. Seems like a bash thing. Why? 

- Darwin compilation problem in siglist

- Check that all global variables are changed via "journal"

-------------------------------------

NECESSARY TO DO:

  - Documentation:
      update sample session ?
      Info for calling from inside script. Developer's handbook?

FEATURES TO ADD:

  0. bash should maintain a list of line numbers that one can
     set breaks on.

  1. perl5db actions

 *2. Debugger should handle errors better. (Does this need bash?)
     Might be able to somehow cascade onto existing Error routine.
     Same might be done with SIGDEBUG.

  3. Add the gdb signal mechanism - it's partly there

  4. "finish" or "return" where frame has been changed from top. 

  Gdb commands that could be added: 
    backtrace -n
    set history filename
    set history name
    set history size
    ignore


FUTURE:

 *More support in bash: list of valid line numbers
 *Rewrite so debugger lives outside of process
   - will not be subject to subshell environment discards. 
   - will have its own global state, but it needs to have access to debugger
     environment 
   - will support remote debugging


*=Things that bash might help out with.
