This is a complete rewrite of the Korn Shell debugger from Bill
Rosenblatt's `Learning the Korn Shell', published by O'Reilly and
Associates (ISBN 1-56592-054-6). Michael Loukides and Cigy Cyriac made
some additional changes. 

The command syntax generally follows that of the GNU debugger gdb.

However this code now depends on a number of debugging support
features that are neither part of the POSIX standard and are not in
older POSIX-like shells. I added support for debugging in bash 2.05b,
which has been encorporated with changes into bash 3.0 with some
change. Note though that you can't use the bashdb code from 2.05b in
bash 3.0 since not all of the changes are upward compatible. Instead
you need the code from the correct 3.x bashdb distribution.

See INSTALL for installation instructions.
