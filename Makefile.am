# This is ugly. Bash 3.0 requires things to be different than where
# many OS's would want to put bash debugger scripts or where a user
# may have asked for this to be put. It's wrong in the directory
# names it uses and for the name of the main include.
# So... using the place that configure determined bash
# wants this to be put, (BASHDB_MAIN), we try to remove any existing files
# before making a symbolic link to it. Also if was in a directory
# (containing perhaps old code), that gets removed and a symbolic link
# is added or relocated if there was another symbolic link. Finally
# the basename that bash wants to use is symlinked to the main name
# that this distribution uses dbg-main.sh, unless those are the same.
